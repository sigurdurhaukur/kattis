Write a program that reads an integer $n$ from the input. The program should
 add five to $n$, then
 triple the value and finally subtract ten. You are welcome to
 simplify the formula if you can, as long as the program gives
 the correct results.


Input
-----


Input consists of one line containing one integer
 $n$, where $\-1\\, 000 \\leq n \\leq 1\\, 000$.


Output
------


Output consists of one line containing one integer, the
 value computed from $n$ as
 described above.
