Reduplication is when one repeats a word several times,
 often to reinforce or alter its meaning. In some languages,
 such as Indonesian, reduplication is very common and serves
 various grammatical functions. Even in Swedish, reduplication
 is used occasionally, for example, saying "hej hej" instead of just "hej".


Rama is a diligent user of reduplication when chatting with
 his friends. He sometimes writes the same word up to nine
 times, which takes a long time. Therefore, he usually writes
 the word once, followed by a number indicating how many times
 the word should be repeated.


Write a program that reads in a word Rama intends to repeat
 and how many times it should be repeated. The program should
 then print the word repeated the correct number of times.


Input
-----


The first line of the input contains a string $s$ ($2
 \\leq \|s\| \\leq 10$), the word Rama wants to write. The
 word consists of letters from a\-z.


The next line contains a digit between $1$ and $9$, the number of times Rama wants to
 write the word.


Output
------


Print $s$ as many times
 as the digit indicates.


Points
------


Your solution will be tested on several test case groups. To
 get the points for a group, it must pass all the test cases in
 the group.




| **Group** | **Point value** | **Constraints** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $1$ | $20$ | The digit is $1$. |
| $2$ | $80$ | No additional constraints. |




| Sample Input 1 | Sample Output 1 |
| --- | --- |
| ``` hej 3  ``` | ``` hejhejhej  ``` |




| Sample Input 2 | Sample Output 2 |
| --- | --- |
| ``` ha 4  ``` | ``` hahahaha  ``` |
