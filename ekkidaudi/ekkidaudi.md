A lot of people write from left to right, but Ketill
 loves to write vertically. A consequence of this is that people
 tend to misread his writings. Ketill has decided to remedy this
 problem by writing a program that converts his writing to a
 more human readable format.
 Input
-----


The input consists of two lines. Each contains at most
 $2100$ characters and the
 character “|” denotes where Ketill
 starts writing on a new line.


Output
------


One line containing the writing of Ketill written from left
 to right.
