Daði Dreki is always practising on how to become more brave
 and next up for him is to see how brave he is in the world of
 mathematics. As everyone knows, only the most daring and
 bravest can find the roots of a second degree polynomial and
 thus Daði wants to become one of them. There is one thing that
 really gets in Daði’s way, that is that some second degree
 polynomials can have one, two or no real valued roots. Thus he
 asks you for help in finding how many real valued roots exist
 to any given second degree polynomial has. Can you help Daði to
 become more brave?


A second degree real polynomial is an expression of the form
 $ax^2 \+ bx \+ c$ where
 $a$, $b$ and $c$ are given real numbers with
 $a \\neq 0$ and
 $x$ is a variable.  

 Example of such a polynomials are:


* $\-2x^2 \+ 7x \- 1$
 where $a \= \-2$,
 $b \= 7$ and
 $c \= \-1$
* $x^2 \- 9$ where
 $a \= 1$, $b \= 0$ and $c \= \- 9$
* $10x^2 \- x$ where
 $a \= 10$, $b \= \-1$ and $c \= 0$


Input
-----


Input consists of three lines, each one contains one
 integer. The first line contains the value of $a$, the second line contains the
 value of $b$, and the
 third line contains the value of $c$. The integers $a, b$ and $c$ are the coefficients of the second
 degree polynomial $ax^2 \+ bx \+
 c$, where $\-100 \\leq a, b,
 c \\leq 100$ and $a \\neq
 0$.


Output
------


Output how many real valued roots Daði’s second degree
 polynomial has.
