The number $S$ is
 called the mean of two numbers $R\_1$ and $R\_2$ if $S$ is equal to $(R\_1\+R\_2\)/2$. Mirkoâ€™s birthday
 present for Slavko was two integers $R\_1$ and $R\_2$. Slavko promptly calculated
 their mean which also happened to be an integer but then lost
 $R\_2$! Help Slavko restore
 $R\_2$.
