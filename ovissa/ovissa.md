Unnar is sure of many things in his life. It is in fact
 so rare that Unnar is uncertain, that it is important to
 measure his level of uncertainty when he is. He says ‘u’ when
 he is uncertain. Unnar’s level of uncertainty is measured by
 the duration of his ‘u’. For example, if Unnar says ‘uuuuu’,
 then his level of uncertainty is $5$.
 Input

 Unnar made the last time he was uncertain. There will be at
 least one and at most $100\,
 000$ symbols in the input.
