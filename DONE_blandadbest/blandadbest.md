Níels is at his favourite kebab place, KFFÍ (Kebab Fyrir
 Forritara á Íslandi) and now he needs to decide what type of
 meat he wants on his kebab. KFFÍ offers a wide range of
 options, a whole two different types, beef or chicken. If you
 are like Níels, you always prefer getting both mixed together.
 Níels goes to the counter and asks for special offer number 5,
 as always, and asks what type of meat they are offering today.
 Of course, if they offer beef and chicken then he will get them
 mixed together, otherwise he is content with only taking the
 one they have, special offer 5 is so good anyway.


Curious as to what Níels got on his kebab, you go to the
 server and ask him what type of meat they are offering
 today.


Input
-----


The first line of input contains a positive integer
 $n$, the number of meat
 types KFFÍ is offering today. Next $n$ lines will follow, each one with a
 unique meat type. The meat type is either "nautakjot" or "kjuklingur".


Output
------


Output what type of meat Níels got with his offer. If Níels
 had only "nautakjot" then you should
 write "nautakjot", if he only got
 "kjuklingur" then you should write
 "kjuklingur" and if Níels had both
 then you should write "blandad
 best".
