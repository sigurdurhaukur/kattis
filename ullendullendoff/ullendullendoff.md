Stefán Valur Hansson, also known as Svalur Handsome, is
 going on an exciting adventure and can bring a single friend
 with him. He doesn’t want to hurt his friends’ feelings so he
 decides to use a mantra to choose someone randomly to bring
 with him. He asks his $n$
 friends to meet him and line up. He starts by pointing at his
 friends that’s furthest to the left and says the first word of
 the mantra. For each word he says he moves his finger to point
 at the next person to the right. If he is already at the
 right-most person he moves back to the front of the line.


The mantra is as follows:



> 
>  Úllen dúllen doff kikke lane koff koffe lane bikke bane úllen
>  dúllen doff.
>  


Can you say which friend will be chosen?
