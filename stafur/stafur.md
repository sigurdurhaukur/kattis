Bjarki just started school and his first assignment in
 English class is about consonants and vowels. In English most
 letters are consonants. The letters that are vowels are a, e,
 i, o, u and sometimes y, but y can also be a consonant. In the
 assignment Bjarki needs to say whether a letter is a vowel. Can
 you help Bjarki with his assignment?
