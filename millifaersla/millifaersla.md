Bjarki forgot his wallet when he went out to eat with
 Hlynur. Hlynur paid for him and told Bjarki that he could use
 the service *Monnei* to pay it back. Bjarki thought
 Monnei had the highest transaction fee, higher than the other
 services *Fjee* and *Dolladollabilljoll*. He told
 Hlynur that he would transfer the money using the service with
 the lowest transaction fee. He needs your help to determine the
 correct service though.


Input
-----


The input consists of three lines. The first line consists
 of a single integer $a$,
 the transaction fee on Monnei. The second line consists of a
 single integer $b$, the
 transaction fee on Fjee. The third line consists of a single
 integer $c$, the
 transaction fee on Dolladollabilljoll.


Output
------


Output the name of the service with the lowest transaction
 fee in a single line.
