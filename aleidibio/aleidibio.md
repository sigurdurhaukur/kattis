Hannes and Arnar are going to the cinema. They have already
 ordered their tickets online and they just ate, so they are not
 stopping in the lobby for snacks and drinks. Therefore, they
 will be able to enter the screening room in no time. Hannes is
 still a bit unsure about when he should get going. Hannes is at
 his house currently. Before Hannes goes to the cinema he must
 pick up Arnar. It will take him $a$ minutes to drive to Arnar. Then he
 needs to drive from Arnarâ€™s location to the cinema which will
 take him $b$ minutes. If
 the film is scheduled to start on minute $c$ of the day, on what minute of the
 day should Hannes start driving, at the latest, so they do not
 miss the advertisements?


Input
-----


The input consists of three lines. The first line consists
 of a single integer $a$,
 the number of minutes it takes to drive from Hannes to Arnar.
 The second line consists of a single integer $b$, the number of minutes it takes to
 drive from Arnar to the cinema. The third line consists of a
 single integer $c$, the
 minute of the day, on which the film is scheduled to start.


Output
------


Output a single integer, the latest possible minute of the
 day, on which Hannes can start driving without them being
 late.
